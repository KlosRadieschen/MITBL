# MITBL (MIT Beverageware License)

A license that combines the standard MIT License with a modified Beerware license.

## Origin

I did not come up with the idea for it. I remember seeing a basic version of this license called the "Strong Beerware License" somewhere on the internet but I was unable to find it again. However, that version implemented the "Beerware part" only as a single sentence. Because of these two reasons, I created a clearer version of the license that is publicly available on GitHub. I also added coffee as that is the life essence of many devs.

## Length

The license is quite a bit longer than the MIT License, Beerware, or even both combined. This is because I changed the "Beerware part" to an obligation, added coffee, and aimed to avoid any possible edge cases or ambiguities.

## Use Case

This is the perfect license to use on less serious projects that you want to open-source for any reason.

## Contribution

Contributions to improve this license or its clarity are welcome! Please feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. I may also consider translating it.
